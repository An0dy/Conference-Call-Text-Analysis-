    "Questioner 1 Q1: [I&SS segment] Regarding the upward revision to guidance for the I&SS segment, which was the greater driver, volume upside or product mix improvement? A1: As in the 2nd Quarter, we believe contributions from volume and product mix improvement were roughly the same. Q2: [I&SS segment] You revised down the outlook for fixed asset growth somewhat. Is this due to improved investment efficiency or some other factor? A2: The change reflects our view that improvements in efficiency will allow us to reach our desired levels of capacity without the degree of investment we had initially anticipated. Questioner 2 Q1: [I&SS segment] You mentioned your lack of optimism about the competitive environment for the I&SS segment in FY2020, but it seems that supply/demand conditions in the industry are still good, so how much of a risk do you actually see? A1: It is difficult to answer in numerical terms, but based on our initial outlook, we made plans to build up strategic inventory in the 4th Quarter in anticipation of very strong demand in 1H FY2020 given how much production capacity we have by comparison. However, we will have to ship, during this fiscal year, almost all of the strategic inventory we planned to build for FY2020, raising the issue of whether we can sufficiently meet demand in FY2020. In addition, 0.8-micron image sensors, which have contributed significantly to FY2019 earnings, will be entering their second year of mass production, so we expect our competitors will catch up to some degree and put pressure on prices. These are the main risks, but it goes without saying that because we have yet to factor in any potential impact from the coronavirus outbreak, we will need to reflect that, too, pending further research, etc. Q2: [G&NS segment] In the game business, what was the degree of contraction in free-to-play games in the 3rd Quarter in comparison with the 1st Quarter and the 2nd Quarter, and, looking ahead to FY2020, should we expect the weakness in free-to-play games to have run its course by the end of FY2019? A2: Most of the sharp decline in third-party software is in free-to-play titles. Other software titles in our library of new and existing games are roughly flat YoY, so this highlights the difficulty in predicting trends in free-to-play titles. In other areas, there were not many variances, so we would like to improve the accuracy of our forecasting here. Questioner 3 Q1: [G&NS segment] Regarding the game business, until now I was under the impression from previous presentations that PlayStation Plus subscriptions tend to grow when triggered by the launch of a major title or other catalyst, suggesting this would be a difficult quarter. However, subscriptions went up despite the fact that software sales were not very strong. What is your take on that, and what are your expectations for subscriber numbers looking ahead to the next-generation console? A1: It is a process of trial and error when it comes to securing stable growth in PlayStation Plus subscribers and retaining them more efficiently. As you know, as a part of the price revisions we implemented in August, we made an annual subscription more affordable with the intention of increasing the number of long-term stable users. Also, we included several incentives with the annual subscription such as online multiplayer gaming, free access to some PS4 titles, 100GB of storage for PS4 game saves, and exclusive subscriber discounts. We believe this made more users appreciate the value of the subscription. The number of subscribers tends to increase in the 3rd Quarter every fiscal year, but we would like to achieve more stable growth by inviting users to experience and appreciate these services. Looking ahead to the next-generation console, we aim to increase subscriber numbers as much as possible. There is very little I can disclose about the new console as of yet, but I look forward to sharing more at some point in FY2020 when we are prepared with more details. Q2: [G&NS segment] The FY2020 earnings outlook for the game business is a frequent topic of discussion in the market given that the PS5 is to be launched for the 2020 holiday season. What are your thoughts, if any, on what would happen if we were to reach the end of April, when the earnings outlook is usually disclosed, and the price of the PS5 had still not been revealed? A2: It is still difficult to discuss that at this time, but what I can say is that at present we plan to deliver our earnings outlook at the same time as usual. Questioner 4 Q1: [EP&S segment] The implied 4th Quarter operating income outlook for the EP&S segment is for a substantial loss judging by your full-year operating income outlook. Broken down into the four main product categories, what are your assumptions regarding sales trends/levels, and what nature and size of non-recurring costs are you expecting? Also, how much of a profit improvement can the EP&S segment deliver in FY2020, including from the disappearance of non-recurring costs? A1: Numerically, guidance does imply a 4th Quarter operating loss in the EP&S segment, but as I touched upon in my speech just now, we are expecting to post one-time restructuring costs in the Mobile Communications business, the impact of which is likely to be very significant. However, we are looking closely from various perspectives into how much this can be minimized, and we aim to keep costs as low as possible. We are not expecting anything outside the bounds of ordinary seasonality at present in the other product categories. 3rd Quarter inventory, as I just mentioned, was also kept very much within appropriate levels. At our previous results briefing, we talked about plans to launch some new products in our TV range in the 4th Quarter and, as of now, those plans remain unchanged. However, if concerns regarding the Chinese supply chain were to come to fruition, there is a risk of delays in ramping up some of the products. Q2: [EP&S segment] Can we assume that these one-off factors will disappear in FY2020 and profit will increase? A2: We have yet to put together our targets for FY2020, but our intention is to make a positive start to FY2020 without any negative hangover from past years, and to that end, we will continue to keep firm control on inventory and make solid manufacturing and marketing plans. Q3: [EP&S segment] If approximately 13 billion yen, the remainder of your restructuring budget to be recognized in the 4th Quarter, is incurred in Mobile Communications, you still would have a loss of 35.8 billion yen for the wider EP&S segment. Is that correct? A3: You can assume something along the lines of your analysis, but please understand that we are not disclosing a detailed breakdown. Q4: [G&NS segment] In the game business, I understand that third-party software sales were not good, but what about first-party titles? A4: I am unable to give you a quantitative answer as to how our results differed from our expectations, but I will give you a general impression. We were not able to meet our assumptions for catalog titles in the case of third-party full-length games or for first-party full-length games in general as those expectations were somewhat ambitious. Results in the PlayStation Plus business and elsewhere were more or less as expected. Questioner 5 Q1: [I&SS segment] Where did production capacity stand at the end of the quarter in the I&SS segment? Also, what were wafer inputs and what do you expect inputs will be going forward? A1: Available monthly capacity was roughly 115,000 as of the end of the 3rd Quarter. We had previously assumed 117,000, so this was down slightly. This is due to slight deviations resulting from factors including process mix and is not because we are behind on building out capacity. We expect capacity to be at 124,000 at the end of the 4th Quarter. As for inputs, we were at full capacity in the 3rd Quarter and expect to be at full capacity again in the 4th Quarter. Q2: [Pictures segment] You mentioned having built up your franchises in the Motion Picture business. Could you share your thinking on the investments you undertook in the 3rd Quarter? Your deal with the production company for Peter Rabbit seems to be in line with your current approach, but your investment in the Game Show Network is of a somewhat different nature. Given that you are undertaking a review of unprofitable channels, could you comment on the intent behind that investment? A2: We acquired the 42% stake AT&T had held in the Game Show Network and made it a wholly owned subsidiary. We had previously held a 58% stake. The Game Show Network is a multimedia entertainment company that distributes game shows, including original programming, via cable television in the U.S. A company under its umbrella called GSN Games also offers online and mobile games. Our thinking was that this business unit had potential from a variety of perspectives, so when presented with the opportunity, we increased our stake to 100% in order to be able to make strategic decisions with greater flexibility. Silvergate Media is a company that develops and produces animation for children and also engages in licensing. It produces seven titles for SVOD and cable television. The objective of our investment was to acquire high-quality original IP and creative talent. We have seen this as an extremely attractive category for some time, and when this acquisition opportunity presented itself amidst various dialogues we were having, we acted and made our decision quickly. Questioner 6 Q1: [I&SS segment] You mentioned a better mix and higher volumes in the I&SS segment in the 3rd Quarter. Could you tell us about the per-wafer sales momentum? It seems to have increased considerably in the 2nd Quarter. Is it fair to say it increased by a similar amount in the 3rd Quarter? Inventory fluctuations meanwhile seem to be a negative for profits this year. Could you share any quantitative data you have on that? A1: Per-wafer sales momentum ends up being a discussion of the unit price per wafer, which is not something we disclose, so I will refrain from any quantitative commentary. Making larger sensors reduces the theoretical yield per wafer, which diminishes production yields. Therefore, the average price per sensor needs to be enough to offset that or it will not be possible to maintain the unit price per wafer. As such, in order to correctly maintain the momentum of per-wafer sales or pricing, we need to be certain we are supplying a high added-value product and improve our production yields, or ensure that new products get off the ground as smoothly as possible. These things enable differentiation and we therefore want to continue to focus our efforts on them. On the question of how inventory fluctuations impact profits, we saw a 7.8 billion yen decline in inventory between the 2nd Quarter and the 3rd Quarter, which was a negative for profits. I believe that the decline reduced profits by 10 billion yen or more on a YoY basis. Q2: [G&NS segment] In striving for a “smooth transition” in the G&NS segment in FY2020, could you describe to the extent possible where you have visibility and where you lack visibility in terms of, for example, development or marketing costs you might be able to control, or things that remain uncertain regarding pricing or volumes perhaps? A2: Firstly, we believe that we absolutely have to control our bill of materials cost. This ends up being a question of what we recognize as costs and is a point over which we must exercise control. Then there is our initial ramp-up. Our manufacturing and marketing efforts need to be solid so that we can determine how many units we need, and then produce the appropriate volume. Given that we compete on price, it is extremely difficult to comment at present on where we lack visibility. In addition, pricing also determines the nature of our promotion efforts and how much we spend because of the balance that needs to be struck, so it is difficult to comment on all of that at this point in time. In terms of making the transition as smooth as possible, we are engaged in ongoing discussions based on our belief that we should devise the best-balanced approach that enables us to ensure that the next-generation console is profitable over the course of its life. Questioner 7 Q1: [I&SS segment] What sort of contribution should we expect from products other than image sensors in the I&SS segment in FY2020 and beyond? A1: That would be sensing inclusive of industrial equipment, factory automation, automotive, and ToF applications. We have said for some time that we want to bring the proportion of products other than image sensors for mobile applications to around 30% by 2025. We have not made any particular changes to that objective and are doing what we need to toward that end. In the short term, our ToF sensors for mobile applications are getting off to a smooth start, so I believe that we will be able to tell you in FY2020 or thereafter what percentage of the business they will likely come to represent. We do not need to invest any capex specifically for ToF sensors, so we see them as having substantial potential. We also believe that we can derive an appropriate level of profit margin from them. Q2: You said that you will be able to increase input without investing as much as you had anticipated. Is there any change in the 700 billion yen figure under your mid-range plan, including in terms of how much outsourcing you intend to use? A2: We have been able to achieve a 15-billion-yen reduction in FY2019 thanks to greater investment efficiency. However, at present we do not expect any major change in our plan to spend 700 billion yen over the timeframe covered by the mid-range plan. The fiscal year ending March 31, 2022 will be the year that we release our next mid-range plan covering 2021-2023, so I believe we will be able to share our thinking on investment over that three-year span at that time. Questioner 8 Q1: [I&SS segment] How is inventory in the I&SS segment likely to change in the 4th Quarter? That likely depends on demand, but could you comment on the general direction? It seems business was extremely brisk in the 3rd Quarter, but with a slight downshift in customer demand underway, do you think that, excluding the impact from the coronavirus outbreak, there will be so much demand in January-March and April-June that you will not be able to produce enough even at full capacity? A1: Our original intention for the 4th Quarter was to build up strategic inventory for 1H FY2020. Thereafter, customer demand became so strong that it proved difficult to engage in strategic stockpiling, and we had no choice but to keep shipping what we had. I am not certain how meaningful it would be to try to describe our expectations exclusive of the impact from the coronavirus, but we believe that we may see some instances of slower demand. Taking all of this into account, we believe that 4th Quarter inventory may not change much, increasing only slightly versus the 3rd Quarter. That said, we have not collected enough information to say anything definitive. Q2: [I&SS segment] What is your output plan for January-March? A2: We do not disclose output plans, but our production lead time is 5-6 months, so please deduce what you can from that.

    "A) Some words that are frequently used in the conference call of Sony are statements that are forward looking such as \"believe\", \"plan\", \"improve\", \"forecast\",\"new\", and \"anticipate\". From an investor standpoint, it would be important to make note of these words because it is important for a company to use language that indicates they are forward looking and intend to be in business for a long time. It is also important from an investor standpoint to see that Sony is looking to innovate and continuously improve and create new products and systems, especially in such a lucrative industry.\n",
    " \n",
    "B) A unique and rare word found in the Q&A portion is \"differentiation\". As an investor, it is definitely important to take note of this word because it indicates how Sony feels they can differentiate from the other competitors, which makes Sony a unique company. Sony also used the work \"free\" in the Q&A portion when talking about their free-to-play games. This was also something important for a potential investor to note because this word indicates that there is a sector of Sony that does not require their customers to pay, which indicates that there will not be any profit will be made from the segment.\n",
    " \n",
    "C) The general sentiment that the managers and analysts presented were overall positive. Although there were definitely questioners that questioned certain decisions Sony had made and were going to make, each person who answered was able to defend the decisions made by the company and continued to use forward looking statements. There were many questions that had vague answers provided, but overall a positive sentiment was used. From an investor standpoint, it is definitely important to see the sentiment of the conference call because it indicates how the managers feel about the company's future and whether it will continue to be profitable or not. The overall sentiment is also a representation of Sony's management itself, and whether they establish a positive tone that is emphasized for all their employees to have as well. Potential investors want to invest in companies that also have good employee satisfaction because it plays an important factor in a company’s success\n",
    " \n",
    "D)Some important topics that were discussed were about the revision and guidance about the I&SS (Imaging & Sensing Solutions) segment and management's outlook on the segment. Many other questions were also about Sony's videogame systems and their media entertainment subsidiary they own and whether they see those sales continuing to grow. From the point of an investor, especially in a technology and product innovation company, it is important that the company an investor is thinking about potentially investing in is continuously looking to innovate and release more products to continue to be profitable and relevant to consumers. It shows that they want to grow each quarter and continue to be a top competitor in the industry.\n"

So far, the big grouping of characters that you have is not very helpful. In fact, it does not really make much sense to analyze characters. What makes more sense is to analyze words. The process of tokenization in NLP takes a string and divides it into smaller parts, such as words. "

    "At least four major obstacles remain in the way of using this text. The overarching/overall problem is that not all of the text is useful. First, we have some words that are duplicated because one is in upper case and the other is in lowercase. Second, some of these tokens are not words at all, but rather are punctuation. Third, some tokens are just single characters, and thus, not very useful for analysis. Fourth, some of the tokens, even though they are words, are not very meaningful. You will address each of these obstacles one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, make all of the words in your token list lowercase. Luckily, Python has a pre-built function which makes strings lowercase. You have a list of strings, so you can use this function, but since you have a list, you will need to go through each token in your list and make each one lowercase. There are at least two ways to do this. The traditional programming way to do this is to use a `for loop`. The more “Pythonic” way to do this is a `list comprehension`. Use both methods and compare and contrast them. The for loop is used for many purposes and is not specifically created to deal with lists. Thus, there are three parts to using the for loop. One, you will create a blank list called `low_tokens`. Two, you will create a for loop that loops through each token in your `tokens` list. Finally, you will make each token lowercase and append it to `low_tokens`. \n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are very useful because they are made to work with lists and to return a list. Thus, a list comprehension is more efficient and easier to write than a for loop for the same purpose. A list comprehension has the following basic format: `new_list = [expression for item in old_list]`. (Finally, a third way to do this, would be to go back to `qa_text` and make the whole string lowercase using string operations (the string module) and then tokenize the string. We don’t have you do this so you can practice using list comprehensions and for loops.)"

    "If the Q&A portion of your conference call is like most others, nearly all of the most frequent words are not that useful. Thus, you need to clear the fourth obstacle discussed above—eliminating useless words. In general the removal of these obstacles, all of this text pre-processing, has two broad categories, noise reduction and normalization. You have been doing noise reduction. This is the process of removing text and other data that is not critical to understanding the fundamental message in the text. Decisions about what text to remove will depend on the goal of the analysis, but normally includes removing punctuation, html tags and stop words. Removing stop words is your next task. Stop words are common words that add little to the meaning of the text, such as \"a\", \"and\", \"or\", etc. Your next step is to compare your list of tokens to a list of stop words and remove any tokens in the stop words list. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many pre-made stop word lists (e.g., from NLTK and the Stanford NLP group), but you will use a custom-made stop word list for this case that will be provided to you. Download the following file and use the code provided here to load the stop word list, after changing the file location to wherever you downloaded the file. "

    "One final obstacle that we have not yet discussed occurs when a test has many versions of the same word. For example, “questions” and “question” have very similar meanings and most of the time you would not want to analyze these as two separate words. Fixing this obstacle is called normalizing the text. Normalization, also called lemmatization, refers to the process of standardizing similar words so that they can be processed together. For example, lemmatizing a word will change each word to its lemma, or its cannonical or root form. For example, it would change \"plays\" to \"play\". Thus, a subsequent text analysis will treat both of these words as one word, \"play\", instead of two different words. "

So the U.S. MCA has been signed, and there is a possibility that we could see Section 232 Tariffs in calendar converted into quaters. So if that happens, your import bill will come down, but what do you think that does to U.S. Midwest premiums? Should we expect to floor in the high teens cents per pound at this point assuming that it's more like a duty paid premium at this point?   \n",

Bill, when we were thinking about making a sequential bridge 3Q versus 4Q, should we exclude $60 million price mix benefit in the Alumina segment?

    "* (A): Write three separate functions that go through each word in each dictionary, respectively and sum the number of tokens that appear in that dictionary. For example, for positive words, define a function. That function should create a `for loop` that goes through every word in a list (which will come from the `token` column) and adds 1 to a variable for every word in that list that is in the `pos_words` list above. \n",
    "* (B): Next, use the `.apply()` function to apply these three function to the `tokens` column, thereby creating three new columns, `pos_sentiment`, `neg_sentiment`, and `uncertainty`.\n",
    "* (C): Finally, get a measure of positive, negative, and uncertain sentiment by taking the percentage of the total words spoken in that row that are positive, negative, and uncertain. That is, create three new variables, `pos_percent`, `neg_percent`, and `uncertain_percent`, which divide the counts just created by the total number of tokens. Thus, for example, for a particular row in the DataFrame, `pos_percent` is `pos_sentiment` divided by the number of tokens in `tokens`.\n",

So us on the street we can think about big numbers with such a large patient opportunity. Maybe tell us how you're thinking about MitraClip over next years and how you think the street should be thinking about it?                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "3140  Okay, great. And maybe a follow-up on Libre. This is a product that's been widely successful, over 100 million run rate in the US, over 1 billion globally. And you really have one major competitor here that's -- let's call it at the upper end of the technology scale. And Abbott in our view is the low cost, easy to access, very easy to use product in continuous glucose monitoring. So, as we think about the evolution of Libre over the next few years, how do you think about Libre staying at the lower end of the cost and ease of use curve versus moving up and trying to compete with your main competitor there? Thanks.                                               \n",
       "3142  from Bank of America. Your line is open.  So two quick questions. First a product question and then an earnings growth question. On the product side, obviously, the context here is that Abbott is a company delivering absolutely top of class revenue growth. But one thing in the quarter that I want to ask about was, neuromodulation that was a little slower like the last quarter. I am just curious, has your outlook for that business changed at all, or is this just still temporary hiring issues and when do you think you can return to more like double-digit growth in that division?                                                                                    \n",

       "3144  Okay. Two other quick little things. What was the US -- imminent US product approval you guys were highlighting in your prepared remarks? And then I also want to just follow up really quickly on David's question on earnings growth. And I realize you start every year at 10%. The street is modeling roughly 12% earnings growth for really the next couple of years. Given all the puts and takes, is that a reasonable place to start or could currency make that a little challenging? Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3147  from Evercore. Your line is open.   Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the nice quarter here. So, Miles, maybe the first one on the sustainability question. If I'm looking at '19, you have MitraClip FMR indication, which is incremental. Libre continues its trends. You have HeartMate 3, which is incremental. Portico US launch, which is incremental, a stable CRM outlook. In neuromod, your comps get easy. Alinity, it should be ramping in the US. It really feels like all the strength we've seen in '18, this should continue into '19. So, maybe can you just talk about some drivers for how we should be thinking about the pluses and the minuses?   \n",

    "While our keyword analysis was helpful, it would be nice to have an automated way to look at what topics each analyst is discussing instead of the manual process you used above with the frequent and rare words.

Topic modeling is a means of extracting hidden topics from large volumes of text. One approach to doing this is called Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In this approach \n",

    "The ultimate goal in this case is to derive meaning in an efficient and effective way about what analysts are asking these companies. You have used two pieces--keywords and sentiment--to do that. Adding the topic modeling will add a third, helpful piece. Below we present results from LDA code that creates topics and displays the most probable topic for each row of the original DataFrame. Sample output from using 99 topics with 20 passes in the LDA model is shown below. Click the link, or copy the PNG file to the same directory/folder as this jupyter notebook if you can't see the graphic. You will see full results for several analysts from the companies you examined before. Specifically, the last column, the `topic` column, lists the topic number and that row’s weight for that topic. The topics are displayed under the picture with their respective topic numbers and the weight of each word in that topic. For example, the first topic shown, number 14, is mostly made up from the word “impact”, which receives a weight of 0.485. Other words that are in this topic are “currency”, and “fx”. Thus, this topic likely indicates that the analyst is asking about the impact of currency fluctuation and foreign currency exchange (FX). "

    "LDA is good for grouping large volumes of unlabeled data. It uses the underlying algorithm to separate and group text data based on the frequency or weight of different words. It can be used to isolate certain topics within the text for the reader to pinpoint specific areas of interest. Using this with the sentiment tool adds a layer of interpretation because based on the topic, negative sentiment could relay to the reader a broad result of performance. Also examining the frequency of the words used allows the user to gain insight on what was discussed. Based on these frequencies an investor or auditor familiar with the business could piece together both topics and overall results from those discussions. The keywords and sentiment tools enhance the LDA model and provide clarity as to why those topics are being discussed heavily. If there are positive keywords associated with it then it could be something the company is performing well in and would want to continue or if they are negative, longer discussions could be about addressing and analyzing the issue or trying to resolve it for the next quarter. \n",

    "Breaking down conversations further into categories could allow someone to sift through information to access it quicker. Examples of this could be questions that involve assessment of management or the handling of certain matters versus general questions about the company. Analysis can also be done to separate the financial matter questions from more subjective matters about the company or business structure. Addressing current matters of company performance versus things management addresses about where the company will be in the future and implementing new strategies could improve results.  \n"
